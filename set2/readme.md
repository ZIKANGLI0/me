TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Through repeated use of for loops, I learned how to iterate over sequences (such as range and lists).

By using the append method, I learned how to add elements to a list.

I understood how to use the str() function to convert numbers into strings.

By writing multiple functions, I learned how to design functions to solve specific problems.

I'm still not clear about the logic of the code in loop7, which I wrote entirely using AI, I tried to get AI to explain the principle for me, but it's still not clear to me, I understand why the expression (width = 2 \* height - 1) is a minus one instead of a plus one
