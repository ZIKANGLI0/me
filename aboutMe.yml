# This format is called YAML which stands for Yet Another Markup Language# It's supposed to be machine readable, and human readable. It does a pretty
# good job of both of those goals, but there are some gotchas:# it's structured as key: value pairs.# You MUST have a space after that colon. key:value will break it.
# anything that starts with a 
#, like this line, is a comment. It's ignored by
# the computer.
# The tests check this file pretty carefully, so make sure it's properly filled in!
